            'Very good. Let me board you a momentâ€”I come in peace.' With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.
            'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman. 'Adios, Senor!' and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.</p>

               <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                 It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
